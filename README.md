# BillBot
A Twitter bot that helps you stay informed with local state legislation

## Background

Hi everyone, my name is Byron and if you know me you know that I love chatGPT. Like many, I have a casual interest in politics, particularly local politics, as it tends to more directly impact my life. However, staying informed about newly introduced legislation can be challenging. Local news coverage is sparse, and who has time to decipher lengthy legislative bills?

That's where BillBot comes in! BillBot is a Twitter bot I created that helps you stay informed with local legislation.  Each week, BillBot finds the latest bills that have been introduced in your state, passes the bill text to chatGPT, and then posts an analysis of the legislation on Twitter in the form of a succinct thread. The analysis includes:
- A brief summary of the bill
- An advocate opinion
- An opposition opinion
- The affected population
